Lab Instructions
================

  Follow the instructions below to experiment with topics related to
  this lab.
  - For sections marked QUIZ, fill in an (X) for the appropriate
    response in this file. Use the command `make test-quiz' to see if
    all of your answers are correct.
  - For sections marked CODE, complete the code indicated. Use the
    command `make test-code' to check if your code is complete.
  - DO NOT CHANGE any parts of this file except the QUIZ sections as it
    may interfere with the tests otherwise.
  - If your `QUESTIONS.txt' file seems corrupted, restore it by copying
    over the `QUESTIONS.txt.bk' backup file.
  - When you complete the exercises, check your answers with `make test'
    and if all is well, create a zip file with `make zip' and upload it
    to Gradescope. Ensure that the Autograder there reflects your local
    results.
  - IF YOU WORK IN A GROUP only one member needs to submit and then add
    the names of their group.


NOTE: Time on loginNN.cselabs.umn.edu
=====================================

  Timing comparisons below reflect the behavior of the benchmark on the
  machines
  ,----
  | login01.cselabs.umn.edu  OR  csel-remote-lnx-01.cselabs.umn.edu
  | ...
  | login06.cselabs.umn.edu  OR  csel-remote-lnx-06.cselabs.umn.edu
  `----
  Run the benchmark there so that your timing allows you to answer quiz
  questions correctly.


CODE: `function_v_macro.c' Program
==================================

  There is nearly complete code provided in the `function_v_macro.c'
  file which implements 4 variants of a `row_sums_XXX()' function.
  Complete the TODO items for each of the 3 functions so that it
  compiles and reports run times for the 3 variants.  Correct execution
  will produce output that looks like the following:
  ,----
  | > ./func_v_macro 100 100000
  | 1.2345e+00 secs : V1 row_sums_func_p
  | 1.2345e+00 secs : V2 row_sums_func_s
  | 1.2345e+00 secs : V3 row_sums_macro
  | 1.2345e+00 secs : V4 row_sums_unroll4
  `----
  NOTE: the times above are not accurate but reflect the format of the
  output.

  You will analyze several aspects of the timing and reasons for the 3
  different variants.


QUIZ: Analyzing `function_v_macro.c' Runs
=========================================

  After completing the code in `func_v_macro.c', compile it via `make'
  and then examine the timing results for the 4 variants by running on
  the following parameters.
  ,----
  | # RUN ON csel-kh1250-NN machines like in project 4
  | > ./func_v_macro 100 100000
  | ...
  `----


ORDERING
~~~~~~~~

  Which of the following indicates the relative speed ordering of the 3
  variants (slowest to fastest).
  ,----
  |       SLOWEST .................................... ..............................FASTEST
  | - ( ) V4 row_sums_unroll4 / V3 row_sums_macro / V2 row_sums_func_s / V1 row_sums_func_p
  | - ( ) V4 row_sums_unroll4 / V1 row_sums_func_p / V3 row_sums_macro / V2 row_sums_func_s
  | - ( ) V1 row_sums_func_p / V3 row_sums_macro / V2 row_sums_func_s / V4 row_sums_unroll4
  | - ( ) V1 row_sums_func_p / V2 row_sums_func_s / V3 row_sums_macro / V4 row_sums_unroll4
  `----


V1 to V2
~~~~~~~~

  Examine the V1 and V2 versions of the `row_sums_XXX()'
  functions. Which of the following best describes the difference
  between these and its affect on performance.
  - ( ) V1 uses pointers to structs while V2 deference's to have local
    copies of the struct; V2 runs slightly SLOWER due to requiring more
    overall memory to store a 2nd copy of the struct
  - ( ) V1 uses pointers to structs while V2 deference's to have local
    copies of the struct; V2 runs slightly FASTER due to some data being
    cached in registers rather than main memory
  - ( ) V1 uses a Function call while V2 uses a Macro call. Since macro
    calls inline code, V2 runs modestly FASTER.
  - ( ) Trick question: these two versions are identical as they both
    use structs and there is no difference in behavior between pointers
    to structs and local / actual structs. They run at the SAME speed.


Preprocessor Macro Expansion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Examine the results of running ONLY the compiler's preprocessor on the
  program which can be done via the command:
  ,----
  | > gcc -E func_v_macro.c > preprocessed.c
  `----

  After running this command the file `preprocessed.c' now contains the
  all text transformations made by the preprocessor to the original
  source. The file will be quite long, ~2500 lines of code. What appears
  for the first few thousand lines of code in the preprocessed file?
  - ( ) Lots of C type declarations and function prototypes for standard
    functions like `atoi()' and `malloc()'; these are the results of
    #include'ing header files. Some of the original C code appears after
    the declarations.
  - ( ) A long sequence of assembly instructions. These instructions are
    what allow the C code to be loaded and run. The original C code
    appears after the initial assembly.
  - ( ) The translation of the original C code into assembly but before
    optimization phases in the compiler.

  Examine the code near the end of the `preprocessed.c' file.

  Which of the following best describes how the V2 `row_sums_func_s()'
  code has changed?
  - ( ) It has not changed much; only comments have been removed.
  - ( ) The body of the `mget() / vset()' functions have been inserted
    at the point they were called.
  - ( ) An optimized assembly code version of these functions appears.

  Which of the following best describes how the `row_sums_macro()' code
  has changed?
  - ( ) It has not changed much; only comments have been removed.
  - ( ) The body of the `MGET() / VSET()' functions have been inserted
    at the point they were called.
  - ( ) An optimized assembly code version of these functions appears.


Function vs Macros Calls and Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Which of the following are valid reasons that calling a function in a
  tight computational loop might interfere with the compiler's ability
  to produce fast code?
  - ( ) Calling a function requires specific registers to be used to
    pass arguments
  - ( ) Calling a function means that all callee save registers might
    change thus reducing the number of registers available for use in
    the calling function.
  - ( ) Calling a function jumps control to a different part of code
    which may put more pressure on the instruction and data cache.
  - ( ) Actually all of these are reasons that functions calls mess up
    optimization and this relation explains why the Macro versions
    perform better as they force inlining of the function body enabling
    further optimizations by the compiler.


Loop Unrolling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Which of the following best describes the differences between the code
  in the V3 `row_sums_macro()' and V4 `V4 row_sums_unroll4()' functions?

  - ( ) V3 iterates through each matrix row by 1 element at time while
    V4 iterates 4 elements at a time
  - ( ) V3 adds on single row element to a single sum per iteration
    while V4 adds 4 different elements to 4 different sums
  - ( ) Because of the looping pattern in V4, it requires a second loop
    to "finish" elements at the ends of rows when the length is not
    evenly divisible by 4
  - ( ) All of these items are true
  - ( ) None of these apply but there are other differences

  Which of the following best explains the speed differences between V3
  and V4?
  - ( ) V4 is FASTER than V3 because its looping pattern favors cache
    more effectively thereby improving throughput: the processor has
    more available data to work on in V4 than in V3
  - ( ) V4 is FASTER than V3 because each loop iteration has more
    independent arithmetic operations that can be executed; this favors
    efficient execution in pipelined / superscalar processors
  - ( ) V4 is SLOWER than V3 because it must add a second loop which
    creates more operations leading to worse performance
  - ( ) V4 is SLOWER than V3 because the additional complexities and
    conditionals in its code create hazards in the processor pipeline
    while P3 has more straight-forward code for the architecture


OPTIONAL: more_macros.c
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You can observe some other uses for `#define' macros in the file
  `more_macros.c'. Again, one can preprocess the C file and observer the
  results using a compiler invocation like
  ,----
  | >> gcc -E more_macros.c > preprocessed.c
  `----
  Examining `preprocessed.c' will show where various capitalized macros
  have been substituted for their definitions. This includes the useful
  `__FILE__' and `__LINE__' macros that are provided in the C standard
  to help print useful debugging information during program runs.
